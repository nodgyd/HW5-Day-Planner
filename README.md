# <HW5-Day-Planner>

## Description
- Motivation for this project was a willingness to have a more organized day that included a structured time stamp to track and organize my days to be more organized.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") Build this project to deepen understanding of local storage concepts and how to set and get data. Also utilizing key value pairs to reference different data points for different usages. 
- What problem does it solve? This solved a huge problem in understanding coding good practices and efficiencies. Utilizing static HTML to create the same entities isn't a consist way of utilizing javascript or HTML.
- What did you learn? The biggest lesson besides the local storage and DOM traversal definitely comes with understanding how to create dynamic HTML elements and manipulating based on the desired outcome.
